# Ship - Open Collective Application

## About Ship

**Ship** is an open-source autonomous AI coding agent that revolutionizes how developers work with GitHub. By assigning issues directly to Ship, developers can watch as it autonomously writes code, creates pull requests, and responds to feedback — all in the background.

### Our Mission

To democratize AI-powered development tools and make every developer 10x more productive by automating repetitive coding tasks while maintaining code quality and security.

## The Problem We Solve

Developers spend significant time on:
- Writing boilerplate code
- Creating and managing pull requests
- Responding to code review feedback
- Fixing repetitive bugs
- Managing issue backlogs

**Ship automates these tasks**, allowing developers to focus on creative problem-solving and innovation.
